  headline: MoRPH Participation in the 30th Applications of Computer Algebra (ACA 2025) in Heraklion, Greece.
  description: The 30th Applications of Computer Algebra (ACA 2025) conference was held from July 14 to 18, 2025, at the Cultural Conference Center of Heraklion on the island of Crete, Greece. This annual event promotes a broad spectrum of computer algebra applications and fosters collaboration between developers of symbolic computation tools and researchers from fields such as science, engineering, education, and mathematics. ACA 2025 featured a diverse set of special sessions, currently 18 in total, covering areas such as computer algebra in education, life sciences, group theory, differential and difference algebra, symbolic modeling in physics and engineering, linear algebra, history, D-finite functions, algebraic geometry, differential operators, sparse interpolation, symbolic-numeric methods, coding theory, finite fields, reliable numerical computing, matrix and tensor equations, and noncommutative algebra. The Computer Algebra Software in the Life Sciences (CASinLife) session, first introduced in 2022, includes a focus on the Mathematics of Reaction Networks. This area primarily focuses on the development of symbolic computation algorithms for analyzing complex biochemical systems, an intersection where mathematically rich questions from life sciences meet advanced algorithmic methods in computer algebra.

Bryan Hernandez, a member of the Mathematics of Reaction Networks group in the Philippines, was invited by the organizers of the session to present his talk titled “Analyzing the Dynamics and Structure of Biochemical Reaction Networks via Network Decomposition.” His presentation highlighted the use of chemical reaction network decomposition to explore the structural properties and long-term dynamics of complex biochemical systems.

In addition to Hernandez’s contribution, the session featured talks from notable researchers including Fabrice Rouillier (France), Atsushi Mochizuki (Japan), Nicola Vassena (Germany), Richard Golnik (Germany), Ovidiu Radulescu (France), Robert Lewis (USA), Sofia Triantafyllou (Greece), Marcus Aichmayr (Germany), Jack Jansma (South Africa), Andrzej Mizera (Poland), and AmirHosein Sadeghimanesh (United Kingdom). The audience included a mix of researchers and students, with interests spanning both theoretical algebra and applied life sciences. Among the attendees was Georg Regensburger, an expert in reaction network theory working on generalized mass-action kinetics and steady-state parametrizations. Feedback on Hernandez’s presentation was highly positive, with questions on potential analogy of the decomposition technique and applications to Boolean networks, multistationarity/multistability analysis, and possible applications in the medical field. Small discussions followed the talks, providing opportunities for deeper engagement and potential future collaborations.
